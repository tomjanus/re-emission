1. Units for pre-impoundment emissions.
For CO2 the unit is t CO2eq/ha/yr, while for CH4 it's in  kg CH4/ha/yr. Double check if there's no error in one of the tables.
2. EFF_TEMP: the coefficient for CO2 is 0.05 but for CH4 it is 0.052. Is this a roundoff error or are these coefficients different (albeit only slightly)?
