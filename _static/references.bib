So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.5–1.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.}",

abstract = {Abstract Lake littoral zones have a transitional nature and dynamic conditions, which are reflected in their CH4 emissions. Thus, detailed studies are needed to assess the littoral CH4 emissions in a regional scale. In this study, CH4 fluxes were followed during the ice-free seasons in 1998 and 1999 by using the static chamber method in the littoral zone of two lakes in Finland. An exceptionally high water level in 1998 caused an unusually long inundation in otherwise ephemerally flooded zone. The flooding was normal in year 1999. The factors controlling CH4 emissions were examined and statistical response functions were constructed. Further, the effect of extended flooding on the littoral CH4 budged was estimated. The methane flux was primarily regulated by the water level in grass and sedge dominated eulittoral zone, but not in infralittoral reed and water lily stands. Methane emissions in the sedge dominated zone decreased significantly, when the flood was high enough to submerge the venting structures of the plants. Besides water level, sediment temperature determined CH4 emission. The cumulative CH4 emissions from the whole littoral wetlands in wet year were 1.1 times (L. Kevätön), or 0.61 and 0.79 times (L. Mekrijärvi) those in dry year. The crucial factor was the discrepancy between the exceptional and the average water level. The extension of inundated area does not necessarily increase CH4 emissions if the flood reaches infrequently inundated areas, which apparently have low CH4 production potential. This is the case especially, if the emissions in lower zones simultaneously decrease due to high water level. Our study analyses these complex responses between CH4 emissions and water level.},

  abstract = {Hundreds of dams have been proposed throughout the Amazon basin, one of the world's largest untapped hydropower frontiers. While hydropower is a potentially clean source of renewable energy, some projects produce high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit electricity generated (carbon intensity). Here we show how carbon intensities of proposed Amazon upland dams (median{\thinspace}={\thinspace}39{\thinspace}kg{\thinspace}CO2eq{\thinspace}MWh−1, 100-year horizon) are often comparable with solar and wind energy, whereas some lowland dams (median{\thinspace}={\thinspace}133{\thinspace}kg{\thinspace}CO2eq{\thinspace}MWh−1) may exceed carbon intensities of fossil-fuel power plants. Based on 158 existing and 351 proposed dams, we present a multi-objective optimization framework showing that low-carbon expansion of Amazon hydropower relies on strategic planning, which is generally linked to placing dams in higher elevations and smaller streams. Ultimately, basin-scale dam planning that considers GHG emissions along with social and ecological externalities will be decisive for sustainable energy development where new hydropower is contemplated.},

abstract = {Proposed hydropower dams at more than 350 sites throughout the Amazon require strategic evaluation of trade-offs between the numerous ecosystem services provided by Earth’s largest and most biodiverse river basin. These services are spatially variable, hence collective impacts of newly built dams depend strongly on their configuration. We use multiobjective optimization to identify portfolios of sites that simultaneously minimize impacts on river flow, river connectivity, sediment transport, fish diversity, and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy production goals. We find that uncoordinated, dam-by-dam hydropower expansion has resulted in forgone ecosystem service benefits. Minimizing further damage from hydropower development requires considering diverse environmental impacts across the entire basin, as well as cooperation among Amazonian nations. Our findings offer a transferable model for the evaluation of hydropower expansion in transboundary basins. Hydropower projects are proliferating in many parts of the world. The benefits they bring in electricity supply are often offset by environmental costs. In an international collaboration, Flecker et al. present a study that aims to optimize the retention of ecosystem services in the face of hydropower expansion in the Amazon basin (see the Perspective by Holtgrieve and Arias). The authors found that simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria (sediment transport, river connectivity, flow regulation, fish biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions) is necessary for optimizing the size and location of dams, and that the geographical scale of planning is also key (benefits from a smaller-scale plan may be detrimental at the basin scale). Their computational method allows the evaluation of each trade-off individually or all trade-offs simultaneously and is broadly applicable in other basin settings. —AMS Computational advances reveal opportunities for more sustainable hydropower development in large transboundary river basins.}}

  abstract = {Abstract Collectively, reservoirs constitute a significant global source of C-based greenhouse gases (GHGs). Yet, global estimates of reservoir carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions remain uncertain, varying more than four-fold in recent analyses. Here we present results from a global application of the Greenhouse Gas from Reservoirs (G-res) model wherein we estimate per-area and per-reservoir CO2 and CH4 fluxes, by specific flux pathway and in a spatially and temporally explicit manner, as a function of reservoir characteristics. We show: (a) CH4 fluxes via degassing and ebullition are much larger than previously recognized and diffusive CH4 fluxes are lower than previously estimated, while CO2 emissions are similar to those reported in past work; (b) per-area reservoir GHG fluxes are >29\% higher than suggested by previous studies, due in large part to our novel inclusion of the degassing flux in our global estimate; (c) CO2 flux is the dominant emissions pathway in boreal regions and CH4 degassing and ebullition are dominant in tropical and subtropical regions, with the highest overall reservoir GHG fluxes in the tropics and subtropics; and (d) reservoir GHG fluxes are quite sensitive to input parameters that are both poorly constrained and likely to be strongly influenced by climate change in coming decades (parameters such as temperature and littoral area, where the latter may be expanded by deepening thermoclines expected to accompany warming surface waters). Together these results highlight a critical need to both better understand climate-related drivers of GHG emission and to better quantify GHG emissions via CH4 ebullition and degassing.},

In this paper, we review the main processes involved in the generation of GHG in reservoir systems and propose a simple approach to quantify the reservoir GHG footprint in terms of the net changes in GHG fluxes to the atmosphere induced by damming, that is, `what the atmosphere sees.' The approach takes into account the pre-impoundment GHG balance of the landscape, the temporal evolution of reservoir GHG emission profile as well as the natural emissions that are displaced to or away from the reservoir site resulting from hydrological and other changes. It also clarifies the portion of the reservoir carbon burial that can potentially be considered an offset to GHG emissions.},

The framework involves the development of statistically robust empirical models describing the four major emission pathways for carbon-based greenhouse gases (GHG) from reservoirs: diffusive CO2 and CH4 emissions, bubbling CH4 emissions from the reservoir surface, and CH4 emissions due to degassing downstream the reservoir, based on an extensive meta-analysis of published data from the past three decades. These empirical models allow the prediction of reservoir-specific emissions, how they may shift over time and account for naturally occurring GHG generating pathways in aquatic networks.},

We provide the first screening of GHG emissions of 141 existing and planned reservoirs in the basin, with a focus on atmospheric gross emissions through the reservoir water surface. The emissions were estimated using statistical models that are based on global emission measurements. The hydropower reservoirs (119) were found to have an emission range of 0.2–1994 kg CO2e MWh−1 over a 100 year lifetime with a median of 26 kg CO2e MWh−1. Hydropower reservoirs facilitating irrigation (22) had generally higher emissions reaching over 22 000 kg CO2e MWh−1. The emission fluxes for all reservoirs (141) had a range of 26–1813 000 t CO2e yr−1 over a 100 year lifetime with a median of 28 000 t CO2e yr−1. Altogether, 82% of hydropower reservoirs (119) and 45% of reservoirs also facilitating irrigation (22) have emissions comparable to other renewable energy sources (&lt;190 kg CO2e MWh−1), while the rest have higher emissions equalling even the emission from fossil fuel power plants (&gt;380 kg CO2e MWh−1). These results are tentative and they suggest that hydropower in the Mekong Region cannot be considered categorically as low-emission energy. Instead, the GHG emissions of hydropower should be carefully considered case-by-case together with the other impacts on the natural and social environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract Methane is an important greenhouse gas with growing atmospheric concentrations. Freshwater lakes and reservoirs contribute substantially to atmospheric methane concentrations, but the magnitude of this contribution is poorly constrained. Uncertainty stems partially from whether the sites currently sampled represent the global population as well as incomplete knowledge of which environmental variables predict methane flux. Thus, determining the main drivers of methane flux across diverse waterbody types will inform more accurate upscaling approaches. Here we use a new database of total, diffusive, and ebullitive areal methane emissions from 313 lakes and reservoirs (ranging in surface area from 6 m2 to 5,400 km2) to identify the best predictors of methane emission. We found that the best predictors of methane emission differed by waterbody type (lakes vs. reservoirs), and that ecosystem morphometric variables (e.g., surface area and maximum depth) were more important predictors in lakes whereas metrics of autochthonous production (e.g., chlorophyll a) were more important in reservoirs. We also found that productivity strongly predicted methane ebullition, whereas ecosystem morphometry and waterbody type were more important predictors of diffusive methane flux. Finally, we identify several knowledge gaps that limit upscaling efforts. First, we need more methane emission measurements in small reservoirs, large lakes, and both natural and artificial ponds. Additionally, more accurate upscaling efforts require improved global information about waterbody surface area, waterbody type (lake vs. reservoir), ice phenology, and the distribution of productivity-related predictor variables such as total phosphorus, DOC, and chlorophyll a.},

  abstract = {A new generalised water resource network modelling Python library, Pywr, is presented. Given hydrological inflows, Pywr simulates customisable water allocation and operation rules throughout complex multi-purpose managed water systems at each user-defined time-step. The model uses a low-level interface to existing linear programming solvers for fast priority-based optimisation-driven simulation. The library uses an object based system for users to provide input data and record simulation outputs. A novel multi-scenario simulation method provides an almost 4-fold improvement in model run-times and supports calculating robustness metrics across scenarios. A flexible interface to specify multi-objective optimisation formulations as part of a model’s input file is included. These features enable analysts to apply advanced water planning approaches, such as robust decision making and robust optimisation, to real systems. The library is available under the GPLv3 open source licence, includes several examples and a regression test suite.},

  abstract = {Surface water reservoirs are increasingly being relied upon to meet rising demands in the context of growing population and changing climate. However, the amount of water available in reservoirs (and the corresponding trends) have not been well quantified at the global scale. Here we use satellite observations to estimate the storage variations of 7245 global reservoirs from 1999 to 2018. Total global reservoir storage has increased at a rate of 27.82{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.08 km3/yr, which is mainly attributed to the construction of new dams. However, the normalized reservoir storage (NS)---the ratio of the actual storage to the storage capacity---has declined by 0.82{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.01{\%}. The decline of NS values is especially pronounced in the global south, while the global north mainly exhibits an NS increase. With predicted decreasing runoff and increasing water demand, these observed diminishing storage returns of reservoir construction will likely persist into the future.},

To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha – with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km3 – may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6\% of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m3 s−1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2\% of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m3 s−1, of which 46.7\% are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity.},

The removal of barriers may be different for each country or region, as each differs greatly in terms of politics, economy and social and cultural awareness. This paper addresses the complex problem of removing dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs. We demonstrate the scales of the changes, including their major ecological, economic, and social impacts. Arguments and approaches to this problem vary across states and regions, depending on the political system, economy and culture, as confirmed by the qualitative and quantitative intensities of the dam removal process and its global geographical variation. The results indicate that the removal of dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs applies predominantly to smaller structures (<{\thinspace}2.5 m). The existing examples provide an important conclusion that dams and reservoirs should be considered with regard to the interrelations between people and the environment. Decisions to deconstruct hydraulic engineering structures (or, likewise, to construct them) have to be applied with scrutiny. Furthermore, all decision-making processes have to be consistent and unified and thus developed to improve the lack of strategies currently implemented across world.},

  abstract = {Hydropower has been the leading source of renewable energy across the world, accounting for up to 71\% of this supply as of 2016. This capacity was built up in North America and Europe between 1920 and 1970 when thousands of dams were built. Big dams stopped being built in developed nations, because the best sites for dams were already developed and environmental and social concerns made the costs unacceptable. Nowadays, more dams are being removed in North America and Europe than are being built. The hydropower industry moved to building dams in the developing world and since the 1970s, began to build even larger hydropower dams along the Mekong River Basin, the Amazon River Basin, and the Congo River Basin. The same problems are being repeated: disrupting river ecology, deforestation, losing aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, releasing substantial greenhouse gases, displacing thousands of people, and altering people’s livelihoods plus affecting the food systems, water quality, and agriculture near them. This paper studies the proliferation of large dams in developing countries and the importance of incorporating climate change into considerations of whether to build a dam along with some of the governance and compensation challenges. We also examine the overestimation of benefits and underestimation of costs along with changes that are needed to address the legitimate social and environmental concerns of people living in areas where dams are planned. Finally, we propose innovative solutions that can move hydropower toward sustainable practices together with solar, wind, and other renewable sources.},

  abstract = {Climate change has become a global burden, requiring strong institutional quality and willingness to mitigate future impacts. Though emissions are transboundary and have the tendency of spreading from high emitting countries to low emitting countries, regional exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation readiness determine the extent of climate effects. The existing literature focuses on immediate drivers and damages of emission effects, failing to account for underlying mechanisms occurring via the nexus between emission levels, economic, social, and governance adaptation readiness. Here, this study broadens the scope of previous attempts and simultaneously examines climate change vulnerability across sectors including ecosystem services, food, health, human habitat, infrastructure, and water. We use the Romano--Wolf technique to test multiple hypotheses and present the spatial--temporal severity of climate vulnerability and readiness to combat climate change and its impacts. Besides, we assess the long-term impact of climate change readiness and income expansion on sectoral-climate vulnerabilities. We find that high-income economies with high social, governance, and economic readiness have low climate vulnerability whereas developing economies with low income have high climate change exposure and sensitivity. Our empirical evidence could be used to prioritize limited resources in addressing and managing adaptive actions of extreme climate change vulnerabilities.},

We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km2 in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km2. Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km2. However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1\% and 6\% of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents ≫77,000 km2 globally, at present. Overall, about 4.6 million km2 of the earth's continental “land” surface (≫3\%) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes, ponds, and impoundments, especially small ones, in global analyses of rates and processes.},

These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 {\%} to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 {\%}.

However, increasing evidence suggests that hydropower reservoirs are an important source of biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), albeit with large uncertainties. Combining spatially resolved assessments of GHG fluxes and hydroelectric capacity databases, we assessed that global GHG emissions from reservoirs is 0.38 Pg CO2 eq.yr−1, accounting for 1.0% of global anthropogenic emissions. The median carbon intensity for hydropower is ∼63.0 kg CO2eq. MWh−1, which is lower than that for fossil fuels, but higher than that for other renewable energy sources. High carbon intensity is mostly linked to shallow (water storage depth <20 m) and eutrophic reservoirs. Furthermore, we found that the reservoir carbon intensity (CI) value would be markedly increased to 131.5 kg CO2eq. MWh−1 when considering the dams under construction and planning. A low-carbon future will benefit from optimal dam planning and management measures, i.e., applying sludge removal treatments, thereby reducing the proportion of shallow reservoirs and anthropogenic pollution.},

  abstract = {To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped. In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

  abstract = {This paper presents the findings of gross carbon dioxide and methane emissions measurements in several Brazilian hydro-reservoirs, compared to thermo power generation. The term ‘gross emissions’ means gas flux measurements from the reservoir surface without natural pre-impoundment emissions by natural bodies such as the river channel, seasonal flooding and terrestrial ecosystems. The net emissions result from deducting pre-existing emissions by the reservoir. A power dam emits biogenic gases such as CO2 and CH4. However, studies comparing gas emissions (gross emissions) from the reservoir surface with emissions by thermo-power generation technologies show that the hydro-based option presents better results in most cases analyzed. In this study, measurements were carried in the Miranda, Barra Bonita, Segredo, Três Marias, Xingó, and Samuel and Tucuruí reservoirs, located in two different climatological regimes. Additional data were used here from measurements taken at the Itaipu and Serra da Mesa reservoirs. Comparisons were also made between emissions from hydro-power plants and their thermo-based equivalents. Bearing in mind that the estimated values for hydro-power plants include emissions that are not totally anthropogenic, the hydro-power plants studied generally posted lower emissions than their equivalent thermo-based counterparts. Hydro-power complexes with greater power densities (capacity/area flooded—W/m2), such as Itaipu, Xingó, Segredo and Miranda, have the best performance, well above thermo-power plants using state-of-the-art technology: combined cycle fueled by natural gas, with 50% efficiency. On the other hand, some hydro-power complexes with low-power density perform only slightly better or even worse than their thermo-power counterparts.},

Hydropower development will disproportionately impact areas of high freshwater megafauna richness in South America, South and East Asia, and the Balkan region. Sub-catchments with a high share of threatened species are considered to be most vulnerable; these are located in Central America, Southeast Asia and in the regions of the Black and Caspian Sea.

Across eco-sensitive river basins, it is unclear how drivers of hydropower expansion, such as rapid economic growth and a low-carbon energy transition, could interact with countervailing forces, such as increasingly cost-competitive variable renewable energy (VRE). Using an integrated energy--water--economy model, we explore the effects of these forces on long-term hydropower expansion in the world's 20 most eco-sensitive basins, which have high ecological richness and untapped hydropower potential. We find that a low-carbon transition exerts the strongest development pressure, causing deployment exceeding 80{\%} of exploitable potential in more than 72{\%} of eco-sensitive basins by 2050, most of which have limited deployment today. Rapid economic growth induces such extensive deployment in only 44{\%} of eco-sensitive basins. Enhanced integration of VRE reduces deployment, alleviating the impacts of rapid economic growth but not the low-carbon transition. Our findings will help to navigate sustainable hydropower development considering both energy-economic and eco-conservation goals.},

  abstract  = {Tackling climate change and human development challenges will require major global investments in renewable energy systems, including possibly into large hydropower. Despite well-known impacts of hydropower dams, most renewable energy assessments neither account for externalities of hydropower nor evaluate possible strategic alternatives. Here we demonstrate how integrating energy systems modeling and strategic hydropower planning can resolve conflicts between renewable energy and dam impacts on rivers. We apply these tools to Myanmar, whose rivers are the last free-flowing rivers of Asia, and where business-as-usual (BAU) plans call for up to 40 GW of new hydropower. We present alternative energy futures that rely more on scalable wind and solar, and less on hydropower (6.7–10.3 GW) than the BAU. Reduced reliance on hydropower allows us to use river basin models to strategically design dam portfolios for minimized impact. Thus, our alternative futures result in greatly reduced impacts on rivers in terms of sediment trapping and habitat fragmentation, and result in lower system costs ($8.4 billion compared to $11.7 billion for the BAU). Our results highlight specific opportunities for Myanmar but also demonstrate global techno-ecological synergies between climate action, equitable human development and conservation of riparian ecosystems and livelihoods.},

A lack of methodologically consistent data sets for many parts of the world, including agriculturally intensive areas of the United States, poses a major challenge to the development of models for predicting emission rates. In this study, we used a systematic approach to measure CO2 and CH4 diffusive and ebullitive emission rates from 32 reservoirs distributed across an agricultural to forested land use gradient in the United States. We found that all reservoirs were a source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with ebullition being the dominant emission pathway in 75\% of the systems. Ebullition was a negligible emission pathway for CO2, and 65\% of sampled reservoirs were a net CO2 sink. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a type of machine learning algorithm, identified reservoir morphology and watershed agricultural land use as important predictors of emission rates. We used the BRT to predict CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in the U.S. state of Ohio and estimate they are the fourth largest anthropogenic CH4 source in the state. Our work demonstrates that CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in our study region can be predicted from information in readily available national geodatabases. Expanded sampling campaigns could generate the data needed to train models for upscaling in other U.S. regions or nationally.},

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends these waterbodies are accounted for in national emission inventories, yet data is extremely limited for irrigated landscapes. To derive a baseline of their greenhouse gas footprint, we investigated 38 irrigation farm dams in horticulture and broadacre cropping in semi-arid NSW, Australia. Dissolved CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in spring and summer, 2021--2022. While all dams were sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, 52{\%} of irrigation farm dams were sinks for CO2 and 70{\%} were sinks for N2O. Relationships in the linear mixed effect models indicate that CO2 concentrations were primarily driven by dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium, and sediment carbon content, while N2O concentration was best explained by an interaction between DO and ammonium. Methane concentrations did not display any relationship with typical biological variables and instead were related to soil salinity, trophic status, and size. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions were highest in small (<{\thinspace}0.001 km2) dams (305 g CO2-eq m−2 season−1) and in those used for recycling irrigation water (249 g CO2-eq m−2 season−1), with CH4 contributing 70{\%} of average CO2-eq emissions. However, irrigation dams had considerably lower CH4 emissions (mean 40 kg ha−1 yr−1) than the IPCC emission factor (EF) of 183 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1 for constructed ponds and lower N2O EF of 0.06{\%} than the indirect EF for agricultural surface waters (0.26{\%}). This synoptic survey reveals existing models may be severely overestimating (4--5 times) farm dam CH4 and N2O emissions in semi-arid irrigation areas. Further research is needed to define these artificial waterbodies in emissions accounting.},

Our revised bottom-up global aquatic methane emissions combine diffusive, ebullitive and/or plant-mediated fluxes from 15 aquatic ecosystems. We emphasize the high variability of methane fluxes within and between aquatic ecosystems and a positively skewed distribution of empirical data, making global estimates sensitive to statistical assumptions and sampling design. We find aquatic ecosystems contribute (median) 41{\%} or (mean) 53{\%} of total global methane emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources. We show that methane emissions increase from natural to impacted aquatic ecosystems and from coastal to freshwater ecosystems. We argue that aquatic emissions will probably increase due to urbanization, eutrophication and positive climate feedbacks and suggest changes in land-use management as potential mitigation strategies to reduce aquatic methane emissions.},

  abstract  = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoirs have most often been evaluated on a global extent through areal scaling or linear-regression models. These models typically rely on a limited number of characteristics such as age, size, and average temperature to estimate per reservoir or areal flux. Such approaches may not be sufficient for describing conditions at all types of reservoirs. Emissions from hydropower reservoirs have received increasing attention as industry and policy makers seek to better understand the role of hydropower in sustainable energy solutions. In the United States (US), hydropower reservoirs span a wide range of climate regions and have diverse design and operational characteristics compared to those most heavily represented in model literature (i.e., large, tropical reservoirs). It is not clear whether estimates based on measurements and modeling of other subsets of reservoirs describe the diverse types of hydropower reservoirs in the US. We applied the Greenhouse Gas from Reservoirs (G‐res) emissions model to 28 hydropower reservoirs located in a variety of ecological, hydrological, and climate settings that represent the range of sizes and types of facilities within the US hydropower fleet. The dominant pathways for resulting GHG emissions estimates in the case-study reservoirs were diffusion of carbon dioxide, followed by methane ebullition. Among these case-study reservoirs, total post-impoundment areal flux of carbon ranges from 84 to 767 mgCm−2d−1, which is less variable than what has been reported through measurements at other US and global reservoirs. The net GHG reservoir footprint was less variable and towards the lower end of the range observed from modeling larger global reservoirs, with a range of 138 to 1,052 g CO2 eq m−2 y−1, while the global study reported a range of 115 to 145,472 g CO2 eq m−2 y−1. High variation in emissions normalized with respect to area and generation highlights the need to be cautious when using area or generation in predicting or communicating emissions footprints for reservoirs relative to those of other energy sources, especially given that many of the hydropower reservoirs in the US serve multiple purposes beyond power generation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Lakes and impoundments are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHG: i.e., CO2, CH4, N2O), yet global emission estimates are based on regionally biased averages and elementary upscaling. We assembled the largest global dataset to date on emission rates of all three GHGs and found they covary with lake size and trophic state. Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25–2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20\% of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with ∼ 75\% of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5–40\% increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13\% of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.},

  abstract = {Globally, flood risk is projected to increase in the future due to climate change and population growth. Here, we quantify the role of dams in flood mitigation, previously unaccounted for in global flood studies, by simulating the floodplain dynamics and flow regulation by dams. We show that, ignoring flow regulation by dams, the average number of people exposed to flooding below dams amount to 9.1 and 15.3 million per year, by the end of the 21st century (holding population constant), for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0, respectively. Accounting for dams reduces the number of people exposed to floods by 20.6 and 12.9{\%} (for RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, respectively). While environmental problems caused by dams warrant further investigations, our results indicate that consideration of dams significantly affect the estimation of future population exposure to flood, emphasizing the need to integrate them in model-based impact analysis of climate change.},

  abstract = {Droughts constrain environmental, economic, and social development around the world. Reservoir hedging rules are commonly used to reduce the risk of severe water shortages, but the effects are closely related to the characteristic of the reservoir water supply system. Previous studies have limited understanding of the key system characteristics that help to determine whether hedging rules are beneficial for drought mitigation. To fill this gap, this study carries out experiments with a hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level (DLWL). We explore the impact of DLWL on system performance i.e., water supply reliability, resilience, and vulnerability, with a range of hypothetical reservoirs, propose the criterion to decide whether the DLWL is applicable, and identify characteristics of reservoirs where DLWL is not applicable via a scenario discovery method. Three types of reservoirs where DLWL is not applicable are identified. Type Ⅰ and type Ⅱ experience structural deficits. Type Ⅰ is characterized by scarce water resources (m < 0.44) and high inflow uncertainty (Cv > 0.60). Type Ⅱ is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity (SI < 0.35). In the type III systems, water demand can always be satisfied and is characterized by the abundance of water resources (m > 0.98) and adequate regulation capacity (SI > 1.02). For the rest of the reservoirs where DLWL is applicable, a multi-objective DLWL optimization method is put forward. Qing River Reservoir in Northeast China is taken as a base case to demonstrate the effectiveness of DLWL and study the influence of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal DLWLs. Results indicate that to cope with increasing water supply pressure featured by increasing total demand, decreasing streamflow, and higher streamflow uncertainty, DLWL during the high-water demand periods ought to be raised and DLWL during the dry season that guides water supply for several months ought to be lowered. Insights from this work have general merit for instructing reservoir managers to take effective drought mitigation measures.},

Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support.

Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

We combine a high-resolution, location-specific, technical assessment with newly developed life cycle impact assessment models, to assess potential biodiversity impacts of possible future hydropower reservoirs, resulting from land occupation, water consumption and methane emissions. We show that careful selection of hydropower reservoirs has a large potential to limit biodiversity impacts, as for example, 0.3{\%} of the global hydropower potential accounts for 25{\%} of the terrestrial biodiversity impact. Local variations, e.g. species richness, are the dominant explanatory factors of the variance in the quantified biodiversity impact and not the mere amount of water consumed, or land occupied per kWh. The biodiversity impacts are mainly caused by land occupation and water consumption, with methane emissions being much less important. Further, we indicate a trade-off risk between terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity impacts, as due to the weak correlation between terrestrial and aquatic impacts, reservoirs with small aquatic biodiversity impacts tend to have larger terrestrial impacts and vice versa.},

  abstract = {The contribution of artificial reservoirs to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been emphasized in previous studies. In the present study, we collected and updated data on GHG emission rates from reservoirs at the global scale, and applied a new classification method based on the hydrobelt concept. Our results showed that CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were significantly different in the hydrobelt groups (p < 0.01), while no significant difference was found for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, possibly due to their limited measurements. We found that annual GHG emissions (calculated as C or N) from global reservoirs amounted to 12.9 Tg CH<sub>4</sub>-C, 50.8 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>-C, and 0.04 Tg N<sub>2</sub>O-N. Furthermore, GHG emissions (calculated as CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) were also estimated for the 1950–2017 period based on the cumulative number and surface area of global reservoirs in the different hydrobelts. The highest increase rate in both the number of reservoirs and their surface area, which occurred from 1950 to the 1980s, led to an increase in GHG emissions from reservoirs. Since then, the increase rate of reservoir construction, and hence GHG emissions, has slowed down. Moreover, we also examined the potential impact of reservoir eutrophication on GHG emissions and found that GHG emissions from reservoirs could increase by 40% under conditions in which total phosphorus would double. In addition, we showed that the characteristics of reservoirs (e.g., geographical location) and their catchments (e.g., surrounding terrestrial net primary production, and precipitation) may influence GHG emissions. Overall, a major finding of our study was to provide an estimate of the impact of large reservoirs during the 1950–2017 period, in terms of GHG emissions. This should help anticipate future GHG emissions from reservoirs considering all reservoirs being planned worldwide. Besides using the classification per hydrobelt and thus reconnecting reservoirs to their watersheds, our study further emphasized the efforts to be made regarding the measurement of GHG emissions in some hydrobelts and in considering the growing number of reservoirs.},

Results suggest that open water methane emission can be predicted from variables such as lake area, water depth, concentrations of total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and methane, and the anoxic lake volume fraction. Using these relations, we provide regional estimates from lakes in Sweden and the upper midwest of the United States. Considering both open water and plant-mediated fluxes, we estimate global emissions as 8–48 Tg CH4 yr−1 (6–16\% of total natural methane emissions and greater than oceanic emission), indicating that lakes should be included as a significant source in global methane budgets.},

abstract = {Abstract Damming creates biogeochemical hotspots along rivers that modify the riverine flow of nutrients, including nitrogen (N). Here, we quantify the impact of dams on global riverine N fluxes using a reservoir N mass balance model. In-reservoir processes represented in the model include primary production, mineralization of organic N, denitrification, and sedimentary burial. In addition, we explicitly account for N fixation as a source of N, assuming that the N to phosphorus (P) ratio of the inflow regulates the magnitude of N fixation in reservoirs. The model is scaled up via a Monte Carlo analysis that yields global relationships between N elimination in reservoirs, either by denitrification or burial, and the hydraulic residence time. These relationships are then combined with N loads to the world's dam reservoirs generated by the Global-NEWS model and the estimated N fixation fluxes. According to the results, in year 2000, worldwide N fixation in reservoirs was on the order of 70 Gmol yr−1, while denitrification and burial in reservoirs eliminated around 270 Gmol yr−1, equal to 7\% of N loading to the global river network. The latter is predicted to double to 14\% by 2030, mainly as a result of the current boom in dam building. The results further imply that, largely due to N fixation in reservoirs, damming causes a global upward shift in riverine N:P ratios, thus lessening N limitation in receiving water bodies.},

abstract={Periphyton (viz. algal) growth in many freshwater systems is associated with severe eutrophication that can impair productive and recreational use of water by billions of people. However, there has been limited analysis of periphyton growth at a global level. To predict where nutrient over-enrichment and undesirable periphyton growth occurs, we combined several databases to model and map global dissolved and total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, climatic and catchment characteristics for up to 1406 larger rivers that were analysed between 1990 and 2016. We predict that 31{\%} of the global landmass contained catchments may exhibit undesirable levels of periphyton growth. Almost three-quarters (76{\%}) of undesirable periphyton growth was caused by P-enrichment and mapped to catchments dominated by agricultural land in North and South America and Europe containing 1.7B people. In contrast, undesirable periphyton growth due to N-enrichment was mapped to parts of North Africa and parts of the Middle East and India affecting 280{\thinspace}M people. The findings of this global modelling approach can be used by landowners and policy makers to better target investment and actions at finer spatial scales to remediate poor water quality owing to periphyton growth.},

  abstract = {Abstract Human activities have increased the input of nitrogen and phosphorus into riverine systems. These inputs can increase algal growth that degrades aquatic ecosystems. We constructed a global database of diffuse loads (kg) and yields (kg ha−1 yr−1) of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus forms for 7 years (centred around 2008) in 1,421 catchments. Yields were calculated from 640,950 measurements that were checked, filtered and harmonized from readily available sources. We used the yield data to create a georeferenced model to calculate yields of nitrogen and phosphorus forms across 6,020 catchments, globally. The database can be used to assess and inform policy to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses from land to freshwater, improve nutrient use efficiency on farms, and help calibrate global models being used to explore scenarios such as nutrient management efficiency in a changing climate. The source data and R code are provided at https://doi.org/10.25400/lincolnuninz.11894697.},

abstract={Waterbodies (natural lakes and reservoirs) are a critical part of a watershed's ecological and hydrological balance, and in many cases dictate the downstream river flows either through natural attenuation or through managed controls. Investigating waterbody dynamics relies primarily on understanding their morphology and geophysical characteristics that are primarily defined by bathymetry. Bathymetric conditions define stage-storage relationships and circulation/transport processes in waterbodies. Yet many studies oversimplify these mechanisms due to unavailability of the bathymetric data. We developed a novel GLObal Bathymetric (GLOBathy) dataset of 1.4+{\thinspace}million waterbodies to align with the well-established global dataset, HydroLAKES. GLOBathy uses a GIS-based framework to generate bathymetric maps based on the waterbody maximum depth estimates and HydroLAKES geometric/geophysical attributes of the waterbodies. The maximum depth estimates are validated at 1,503 waterbodies, making use of several observed data sources. We also provide estimations for head-Area-Volume (h-A-V) relationships of the HydroLAKES waterbodies, driven from the bathymetric maps of the GLOBathy dataset. The h-A-V relationships provide essential information for water balance and hydrological studies of global waterbody systems.},

abstract = {Across continental Africa, more than 300 new hydropower projects are under consideration to meet the future energy demand that is expected based on the growing population and increasing energy access. Yet large uncertainties associated with hydroclimatic and socioeconomic changes challenge hydropower planning. In this work, we show that only 40 to 68\% of the candidate hydropower capacity in Africa is economically attractive. By analyzing the African energy systems’ development from 2020 to 2050 for different scenarios of energy demand, land-use change, and climate impacts on water availability, we find that wind and solar outcompete hydropower by 2030. An additional 1.8 to 4\% increase in annual continental investment ensures reliability against future hydroclimatic variability. However, cooperation between countries is needed to overcome the divergent spatial distribution of investment costs and potential energy deficits. A growing population and increasing energy demand have spurred investments in hydropower generation in Africa. At the same time, the cost of power from other types of renewable sources has continued to drop. Carlino et al. explored the ramifications of this trend on the economics of hydropower. They analyzed the African energy landscape from 2020 to 2050, and predicted that the declining cost of wind and solar power will make a large fraction of the current hydropower candidate installations economically uncompetitive over that period. Cooperation between countries could help to overcome the regionally unequal distribution of investment costs and potential energy deficits. —H.

abstract={Reservoir drawdown areas---where sediment is exposed to the atmosphere due to water-level fluctuations---are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15{\%} of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO2 and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15--40) (95{\%} confidence interval) TgCO2-C yr−1 to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO2 emissions from reservoirs by 53{\%} (60.3 (43.2--79.5) TgCO2-C yr−1). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04--4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle.},

abstract = {A large part of the world's inland waters, including streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and reservoirs is subject to occasional, recurrent or even permanent drying. Moreover, the occurrence and intensity of drying events are increasing in many areas of the world because of climate change, water abstraction, and land use alteration. Yet, information on the gaseous carbon (C) fluxes from dry inland waters is scarce, thus precluding a comprehensive assessment of C emissions including all, also intermittently dry, inland waters. Here, we review current knowledge on gaseous C fluxes from lotic (streams and rivers) and lentic (ponds, lakes, and reservoirs) inland waters during dry phases and the response to rewetting, considering controls and sources as well as implications of including ‘dry’ fluxes for local and global scale estimates. Moreover, knowledge gaps and research needs are discussed. Our conservative estimates indicate that adding emissions from dry inland waters to current global estimates of CO2 emissions from inland waters could result in an increase of 0.22 Pg C year−1, or ~10% of total fluxes. We outline the necessary conceptual understanding to successfully include dry phases in a more complete picture of inland water C emissions and identify potential implications for global C cycle feedbacks.}
