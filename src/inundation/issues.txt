Resolution is two-fold in issues:
Both (low and high resolution) resutls in large inudated area
but low resolution tends to understimate compared to high resolution (which can be countered by
the use of original resolution after delineation part)


Other senstivies parameters:
1. stream order
2. accuracy for locations of dems
3. above-ground height of dams 


Suggestions:
Better validate the results with manual processes using GIS software (for weird looking inudations such as 
long-stretched one, weredly large and small inudation areas or better avoid in the study for those locations.)
