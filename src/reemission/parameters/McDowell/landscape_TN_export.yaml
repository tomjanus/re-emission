# McDowell et al. 2020 landscape TN export model
# Regression model based on global empirical solute data
# Biomes categorical as intercept terms.
# Model predicts natural log (mg/L) to which the bias correction factor is
# applied. The mean annual catchment TN loading (kg yr-1) is then the predicted
# concentration (mg/L) * annual discharge (m3 yr-1) * 10-3
# Units and descriptions
# mean_prec: Mean precipitation (mean monthly, mm)
# mean_slope: Mean slope of the catchment (%)
# cropland: Percent of catchment area covered with croplands (%)
# soil_wet: Soil wetness (mm over profile)
# corr: Bias correction factor (-)
# coeff_det: Coefficient of determination (-)
# Biomes
# 1: deserts & xeric shrublands
# 2: mediterranean forests, woodlands & scrub
# 3: montane grasslands & shrublands
# 4: temperate broadleaf & mixed forests
# 5: temperate conifer forests
# 6: temperate grasslands, savannas & shrublands
