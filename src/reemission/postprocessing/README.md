# Steps to visualising combined geocaret and reemission results

1. Read tabular (.csv) outputs from geocaret
2. Copy fields from the tabular geocaret outputs to reservoir, catchment and dam shape files
3. Read re-emission output json file
4. Copy emission output data from re-emission outpu json file to reservoir shape file
5. Create a map in html format with the updated reservoir, catchment and dam shapes using Folium
